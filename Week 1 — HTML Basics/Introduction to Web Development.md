## 🖥 How Web Development Works

A website works by combining **Frontend** and **Backend**:

1. **Frontend (Client-Side)**  
   - What the user sees and interacts with.  
   - Includes layout, design, buttons, forms, and interactivity.  
   - Runs in the **browser**.

2. **Backend (Server-Side)**  
   - Server, database, and application logic.  
   - Handles storing and retrieving data.  
   - Runs on the **server**.

3. **Database**  
   - Stores information like users, posts, products, etc.  
   - Common databases: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

**Workflow Example:**  
`User → Browser → Frontend → Backend → Database → Response → Browser`
